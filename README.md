The Crane Robot is a compact, omnidirectional robotic system integrating mechanical design, electronics, and software for remote and autonomous operation. 
Its aluminum chassis with a wooden base supports Mecanum wheels powered by 150:1 6V DC motors, allowing multidirectional movement. 
The 3D-printed arm utilizes a rack and pinion system driven by a 5V stepper motor for vertical motion, while the servo-powered claw features a planetary gearbox for precise gripping.
An Arduino Uno controls the system, managing motor functions via H-bridges, powered by a 6V 4A battery, and operated through an IR remote.
The robot is programmed in Arduino IDE
